This project demonstrates a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox with semantic HTML5 elements. It includes:

- A full-page layout structured with `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.
- Within `<main>`, two sections: `<article>` (primary content) and `<aside>` (sidebar).
- Flexbox is used to create a clean, responsive design where:
  - `<body>` is a vertical column layout.
  - `<main>` is a horizontal row layout.
  - `<article>` takes up 2/3 of the width.
  - `<aside>` takes up 1/3 of the width.
  - Both are scrollable if content overflows.
